            Senior Engineer with a track record of defining, scaling, and
            operating distributed systems in high-throughput production
            environments. Recognized for setting technical direction across
            teams, translating business constraints into durable architectures,
            and driving platform-level decisions. Extensive experience designing
            service-oriented and serverless systems handling millions of
            requests, with deep expertise in API design, data modeling,
            cloud-native infrastructure, and performance-critical components
            implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Rust.
          </p>
          <span class="bold">
            <p>Technical Scope & Impact</p>
          </span>
          <p>
            I define and evolve large-scale distributed systems, making
            architectural decisions that balance scalability, reliability, cost
            efficiency, and developer productivity over long system lifecycles.
            I lead the design of microservices and serverless architectures,
            establishing clear service boundaries, data ownership models, and
            inter-service communication patterns that enable independent team
            execution while maintaining platform coherence. I set
            organization-wide standards for API design using REST and GraphQL,
            with a strong emphasis on versioning, backward compatibility, and
            contract clarity. My primary implementation languages are
            JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Rust, with Rust applied
            deliberately in performance-sensitive or resource-constrained
            components. I remain hands-on at the code level where it materially
            impacts system correctness, performance, or long-term
            maintainability, and I provide deep technical guidance through
            design reviews and code reviews across teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            I own data architecture decisions across relational and
            non-relational systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, DynamoDB,
            MongoDB, and Redis. This includes defining schemas, indexing
            strategies, and access patterns that support high-throughput,
            low-latency workloads, as well as guiding teams through consistency
            trade-offs, schema migrations, and long-term data evolution. I
            design and standardize AWS-native platforms using Lambda, API
            Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, EC2, and Cognito, with infrastructure defined
            and maintained through Terraform and CloudFormation. I establish
            operational practices for observability, alerting, and cost
            governance, ensuring systems are production-ready, measurable, and
            economically sustainable. I also define expectations around CI/CD
            pipelines, automated testing, and safe deployment strategies,
            championing test-driven development and production readiness as
            non-negotiable engineering standards. Security and governance are
            integral to my architectural work. I define authentication and
            authorization models using OAuth 2.0 and JWT, standardize API
            documentation and contracts through OpenAPI, and partner closely
            with security and compliance stakeholders to embed controls at the
            platform level rather than retrofitting them at the application
            layer.
          </p>
          <span class="bold">
            <p>Leadership</p>
          </span>
          <p>
            I operate as a technical authority across multiple teams, shaping
            architectural direction and influencing roadmap decisions through
            clear, well-reasoned technical strategy. I mentor senior engineers
            and technical leads, improving decision quality, raising engineering
            standards, and developing future architectural leaders within the
            organization. I serve as a bridge between engineering leadership,
            product, and business stakeholders, translating ambiguous
            requirements and business constraints into coherent technical
            direction and executable plans. My focus is on enabling teams to
            move quickly without compromising system integrity, while ensuring
            that short-term decisions align with long-term platform
            sustainability.
