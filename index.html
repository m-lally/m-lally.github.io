            <p>
              As a Senior Software Engineer and Platform & Architecture Lead, I
              design and operate distributed systems that form the backbone of
              high-growth companies. My approach centers on translating complex
              business constraints into elegant, durable technical solutions
              that scale reliably while remaining operationally sustainable.
              I've led cross-functional teams through architectural
              transformations, established platform-wide standards, and
              consistently elevated engineering maturity across organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm hands-on across the full stack—TypeScript/Node for rapid
              iteration and scale, Python for data systems and automation, Rust
              for performance-critical components—but my real strength is
              knowing when and why to use each tool. I architect with intention:
              clear service boundaries, intentional data models, robust
              observability, and security as a first-class concern. I mentor the
              next generation of technical leaders and drive decisions through
              data-driven strategy rather than dogma. When systems fail or
              decisions need making under ambiguity, I'm the person who thinks
              clearly, communicates effectively, and delivers results.
