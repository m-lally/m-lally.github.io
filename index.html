            Senior Engineer with a track record of defining, scaling, and
            operating distributed systems in high-throughput production
            environments. Recognized for setting technical direction across
            teams, translating business constraints into durable architectures
            and driving platform-level decisions. Extensive experience designing
            service-oriented and serverless systems handling millions of
            requests, with deep expertise in API design, data modeling,
            cloud-native infrastructure, and performance-critical components
            implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript mostly with some Python, and
            Rust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Architect and technical authority building distributed systems
            handling millions of requests in production. Drive platform strategy
            across multi-disciplinary teams, translating complex business
            constraints into scalable, fault-tolerant architectures. Deep
            expertise in service-oriented and serverless design, data systems
            optimization, API contracts, and cost-efficient cloud
            infrastructure. Hands-on with TypeScript/Node, Python, and
            Rust—deliberately selecting the right tool for performance,
            security, and long-term maintainability. Demonstrated track record
            elevating engineering standards, mentoring technical leaders, and
            delivering systems that scale reliably while remaining operationally
            sustainable.

            <p>Technical Scope & Impact</p>
          </span>
          <p>
            Define and evolve large-scale distributed systems, making
            architectural decisions that optimize for scalability, reliability,
            cost efficiency, and developer velocity. Lead the design of
            service-oriented and serverless architectures with explicit
            attention to: clear service boundaries, data ownership and
            consistency models, inter-service communication patterns, and
            operational visibility. Establish organization-wide API design
            standards using REST and GraphQL, with rigorous governance around
            versioning, backward compatibility, contract clarity, and
            discoverability. Code at the level where it materially impacts
            correctness, performance, or future maintainability—leveraging
            TypeScript/Node for rapid iteration, Python for data systems and
            scripting, and Rust for performance-critical, resource-constrained
            components. Lead technical design reviews and code reviews to
            elevate architectural thinking and catch systemic issues early.
          </p>
          <p>
            Own data architecture decisions across SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and
            NoSQL systems (DynamoDB, MongoDB, Redis), including schema design,
            indexing strategies, and access patterns that support
            high-throughput, low-latency workloads. Guide teams through
            consistency trade-offs, handle complex schema migrations, and
            architect for long-term data evolution without breaking changes.
            Design and standardize AWS-native platforms leveraging Lambda, API
            Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, EC2, and Cognito, with infrastructure as code
            via Terraform and CloudFormation. Establish observability frameworks
            (structured logging, metrics, traces), alerting strategies, and cost
            governance models to ensure systems are production-ready,
            measurable, and economically sustainable at scale. Define CI/CD
            expectations and deployment safety practices, advocating for
            test-driven development and production readiness as non-negotiable
            standards. Embed authentication and authorization as first-class
            architecture concerns using OAuth 2.0, JWT, and OpenID Connect.
            Standardize API contracts and documentation through OpenAPI to
            reduce integration friction. Partner with security and compliance
            teams to embed controls at the platform level, not retrofit at the
            application layer.
          </p>
          <span class="bold">
            <p>Leadership</p>
          </span>
          <p>
            Operate as technical authority across multiple teams, driving
            architectural direction and influencing roadmap priorities through
            data-driven technical strategy and clear decision frameworks. Mentor
            senior engineers and emerging technical leads—elevating decision
            quality, establishing shared architectural principles, and
            developing the next generation of technical leaders. Bridge
            engineering leadership, product, and business stakeholders,
            translating ambiguous requirements and competitive constraints into
            coherent technical direction and credible delivery plans. Focus on
            enabling teams to move at velocity without sacrificing system
            integrity, ensuring short-term tactical decisions align with
            long-term platform health and organizational scalability.
